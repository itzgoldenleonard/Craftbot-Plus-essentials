## Tips

Here are a bunch of other little tips in no particular order that can improve your printing experience.
- Update the firmware on your printer, some of the new features are nice
- Take the time to learn a good slicer program like PrusaSlicer
- Buying a flexible build plate makes it much easier to get prints off when they're done


## Project structure

The `CAD` folder contains the raw FreeCAD files and .step versions (that I try to keep up to date), you might want to edit them to make them suit your needs.
`doc` and `images` just contain documentation and images, remember to add that if you want to contribute another component to the project.
`prints` has the stl mesh files that you can slice and print. It also has pre sliced versions ready to print on a Craftbot Plus. If you contribute a component you also have to make these files for it.
