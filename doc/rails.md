# Rail system

All components can be attatched to the printer with these rails. They can be screwed onto the printer with the M3 screws on the top side (see the GIF for installation instructions). They can be printed in any length you need. 
You need to thorougly remove the supports or they wont work, and they're very tight. It's probably a good idea to slide the component back and forth a few times on the first installation.
